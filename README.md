# #Mood: an api-project

Group Project for CWRU combinging a few API's to generate movie suggestions and trailer based on user mood input. 

**Motivation**

We set out to build a simple app to suggest movies based on your mood. No more decisions to make, just choose an emoji and voila! You have 6 movies perfect for how you feel. We also wanted it to be random, giving you different movies everytime you interacted with the app.


**Future Features** 

Help us make it better.
