# api-project

Group Project for CWRU combinging a few API's to generate movie suggestions and trailer based on user mood input. 

**Motivation
We set out to build a simple app to suggest movies based on your mood. No more decisions to make, just choose an emoji and voila! You have 5 movies perfect for how you feel. We also wanted it to be random, giving you different movies everytime you interacted with the app.

Future Features exploration: 
  Facial recognition: take a selfie and get back movies 
  Voice recognition:
